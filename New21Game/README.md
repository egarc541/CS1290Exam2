# 837. New 21 Game
LeetCode Problems<br> 
CS1290 Exam 2 

# Problem 
Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?

# Approach
For this problem solution had to be found using the IDEAL and Duke 7 Steps approach. In this type of problems were solution
is complex I had issues trying to solve it using the IDEAL approach due to having too many steps in which first trying to 
find a reliable algorithm to ensure getting the probability of Alice getting less points in her new 21 game. I had to approach
it also by using the duke 7 steps but lost track of many extra steps I had to do in order to really understood the process of 
solving it. In coclusion, I picked this problem to understand how dynamic programming could be use to solve an algorithm in
which problability has to to found and also it could be solve with a recursive equation.
