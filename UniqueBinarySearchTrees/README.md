# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees
LeetCode Problems<br>
CS1290 Exam 2 

# Problem 
Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?

# Approach
For this problem I had to use two different approaches the IDEAL and the Duke 7 steps. For this problem the duke 7 was more
situable due to taking the step of drawing and finding patterns while also tracking that the BST's are unique the values 
being from 1 to n. After running several test cases I found that using dynamic programming to allocate space in 
the array was more reliable even though on time complexity was not O(N).
