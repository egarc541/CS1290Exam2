# 19. Remove Nth node from End of List
LeetCode Problems\ 
CS1290 Exam 2 

# Problem 
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

# Approach
For this problem I had to used two approaches to find a solution, which consists of IDEAL and Duke 7 Steps. I first start
it using the Duke 7 steps but found out that it was extra steps due to the problem being simple. While using the IDEAL 
approach I found that it was an easy problem which consisted of just getting the length of the list and removing the n 
position of it. There was only one way of solving while exploring solutions which was using the formula (L - n + 1) which
moves length from last to head in the list with also using the dummy list.
