# 287. Find the Duplicate Number
LeetCode Problem\
CS1290 Exam 2

# Problem
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one

# Approach
For this problem I had to used the IDEAL and Duke 7 steps in order to find an easier way of getting a solution. After, starting
to understand the code I found that Duke 7 step does not really work with this type of problem due its simple requirement which
is only finding a duplicate number in an array, so I had to use IDEAL. For this problem you will have to first identify the what
is really asking, which as I mentioned before just finding a duplicate number in the array given. Defining the problem was not 
difficult as its easier to check the numbers with a HashSet of Integers that will check through each number in the array and if 
the number was already inserted in the set it will return it or if its not it will add the number. For this problem as I define
it I explore the possible solution and act on it.
