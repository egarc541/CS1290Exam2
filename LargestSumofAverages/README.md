# 813. Largest Sum of Averages
LeetCode Problems\
CS1290 Exam 2

# Problem
We partition a row of numbers A into at most K adjacent (non-empty) groups, then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest score we can achieve? Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not necessarily integers.

# Approach
For this problem I had to used two different approaches in order to find a solution. Although running the problem through different test cases and scenarios, the example was really helpful because it help me understand that partioning the largest 
numbers in the array would allow the largest number be found in the average. At the end after running both approaches 
the IDEAL was more benefitial due to getting the example to work on words. Exploring solutions using dynamic programming was 
helpful to understand how allocating space through the array and searching for the length assisted at the end to find the sum
of the largest numbers store by only setting the number used in K to arrage groups of numbers.
