# 537. Complex Number Multiplication
LeetCode Problem\ 
CS1290 Exam 2

# Problem
Given two strings representing two complex numbers.
You need to return a string representing their multiplication.<br> Note i2 = -1 according to the definition

# Approached for Solution
For this problem I had to use IDEAL and Duke 7 Step approaches to understand and find a solution. I first try the IDEAL
approach but it did not help as the problem is kind of complex because instead of adding numbers you will have to first
understand how to add and get the String out of the equation. The easier approach I used was the Duke 7 Step which consited
of understanding that the 'i' had to be split from the equation. My approach was first understanding and remembering how
complex multiplaction work with imaginary numbers. I had to remember that when you multiply two imaginary numbers there is a
negative number out of it. For the second step I had write down in paper the example given and try to find a pattern in which
it could have being translated into code. I found that split the 'i' from the equation was benefitial and parsing the values
from the string into an integer help when I had to return the equation into a string. For the last step was making sure it would
differentiate the types in the string and bring up a solution.
